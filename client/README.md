# Ticketing System

A full-stack web application that allows users to manage devices and submit tickets to those devices. Each user has a private view of their own tickets and can intereact with a shared device inventory.

## Features

-  User authentication (Sign up / Log in / Log out)
-  View a list of all devices in the system
-  Add new devices to the inventory
-  Create, edit, and delete support tickets for any device
-  Tickets are user-specific â€” each user can only view or manage their own tickets
